Compiler: SysGcc cross-compiler arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.9.2\r\n  2. You can get it here: http://gnutoolchains.com/raspberry/\r\n3. The project file included is from eclipse CDT LUNA\r\n \r\n## Architecture\r\n- This API is based on small libraries with a couple of headers each.\r\n- The external headers of each library contain only pure C functions and or a C++ pure virtual classes with its respective pure C factories\r\n- Each library is in its own folder and has its respective unit test application\r\n- The CppUnit test framework is included in this project and is always statically linked to the test applications\r\n\r\n## Values\r\n1. User friendly API\r\n2. Mantainability\r\n3. Extensibility\r\n4. Backwards compatibility\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n1. Core functions (sleeps, threads, soft real-time, timers, clocks)\r\n  1. Configuration file parser\r\n2. GPIOs\r\n3. Communication (Serial, SPI, I2C)\r\n4. Control structures (PID, PT1, debouncer, Schmitt trigger)\r\n5. Error handling, logs, status reports\r\n \r\n## Depelopers Documentation\r\n[Read more](Doc/html/index.html)\r\n",
