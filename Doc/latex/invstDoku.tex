I am a C/\+C++ A\+P\+I or library to write automation applications with the Raspberry Pi. I ease the programming of applications by providing an abstraction layer with the most common ready-\/to-\/use functions used in automation applications.

My main goal is to allow non C/\+C++ and linux experts to write reliable applications to automate stuff. Examples could be home automation, automated gardens, hobbyists\textquotesingle{} experimets, etc.

With me you can access G\+P\+I\+O\+S (inputs and outputs) and communication buses. You can create high priority automation deamons and threads with defined cycle times. On top of that, I provide logging functions to track errors, messages with state to avoid spamming your log and much more.

This software is free like free beer under the L\+G\+P\+L and aims to promote the idea of {\itshape give something back to the world}.
