 Welcome to the documentation of the Base A\+P\+I.~\newline
 This A\+P\+I is meant to facilitate the programming of the Raspberry Pi (R) by providing libraries. This documentation is meant to explain how to use the libraries or A\+P\+Is rather than its internal functioning. Therefore the target group is programmers willing to use the A\+P\+I rather than further developing it.\hypertarget{index_intro_sec}{}\section{Basic Architecture}\label{index_intro_sec}
This A\+P\+I tries to provide two interface flavors for each of each libraries\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A flat C-\/\+A\+P\+I, and
\item a C++ pure abstract interface with C-\/style constructors and destructors.
\end{DoxyItemize}

This way it is easier to please both C and C++ programmers. Depending on convenience, either the C++ A\+P\+I is a wrapper of the C A\+P\+I, or vice versa. Therefore, there is no point in using one or the other for performance reasons unless explicitly stated in the function description.~\newline
